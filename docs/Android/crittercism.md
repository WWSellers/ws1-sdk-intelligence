## DEX Telemetry Opt-in

In order to use the DEX Telemetry Feature, the application must Opt-In using the following API after initializing the SDK.

Example: Set Opt In Status
```JAVA
// Must Initialize the Crittercism object before setting status
Crittercism.initialize(context, MY_APP_ID, crittercismConfig)

// Used to set the Opt-In status of the Intelligence SDK
Crittercism.setSdkOptInStatus(true)
// Used to get the Opt-In status of the Intelligence SDK
val sdkOptInStatus = Crittercism.getSdkOptInStatus()

// Used to Opt-in to DEX Telemetry Feature.
Crittercism.setTelemetryOptInStatus(TelemetryFeature.DEX)
// Used to get Opt-in status of DEX Telemetry Feature.
val dexOptInStatus =  Crittercism.getTelemetryOptInStatus(TelemetryFeature.DEX)
// Used to Opt-Out of All Telemetry Features.
Crittercism.telemetryOptOut()
```

## Logging Breadcrumbs

A ***breadcrumb*** is a developer-defined text string (up to 140 characters) that allows developers to capture app run-time information. Example breadcrumbs may include variable values, progress through the code, user actions, or low memory warnings. For an introduction, see [Breadcrumbs](../../dev-centre/ws1-intel/core-capabilities.md#breadcrumbs-overview).

### leaveBreadcrumb (breadcrumb)

Breadcrumbs provide the ability to track activity within your app. A breadcrumb is a free form string you supply, which will be timestamped, and stored in case a crash occurs. Crash reports will contain the breadcrumb trail from the run of your app that crashed, as well as that of the prior run.

Userflows will also contain breadcrumbs that are created between the userflow’s start and end timestamp.

Breadcrumbs are limited to 140 characters, and only the most recent 100 are kept.

Omnissa Intelligence SDK will automatically insert a breadcrumb marked session_start on each initial launch, or foreground of your app.

**Declaration**

```JAVA
public static void leaveBreadcrumb (String breadcrumb)
```

**Parameters**

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| breadcrumb | The custom string to leave a breadcrumb, maximum of 140 characters |

### leaveUserflowSpecificBreadcrumb(final String userflowName, final String text)

Logs text that will be reported only to the specified userflow. Even if other userflows are open and active, they will not have this breadcrumb associated with it.

Breadcrumbs not specified under an active userflow will operate on the traditional breadcrumb logic.

Breadcrumbs are limited to 140 characters, and only the most recent 100 are kept.

**Declaration**

```JAVA
public static void leaveUserflowSpecificBreadcrumb(@NonNull final String userflowName, @NonNull final String text)
```

**Parameters**

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| userflowName | Name of the userflow to assign breadcrumb with |
| text | The custom string to leave a breadcrumb, maximum of 140 characters |

Here’s an example of how to instrument a client:

Android Userflow Specific Breadcrumb Examples

```JAVA
Crittercism.leaveUserflowSpecificBreadcrumb("appLogin", "userTappedSubmit")
```

## Logging Handled Exceptions

### logHandledException (exception)

Handled exceptions may be used for tracking exceptions caught in a try/catch statement, 3rd party library exceptions, and monitoring areas in the code that may currently be using assertions. Handled exceptions can also be used to track error events such as low memory warnings. For an introduction, see [Handled Exceptions](../../dev-centre/ws1-intel/core-capabilities.md#handled-exceptions).

Handled exceptions are grouped by stacktrace, much like crash reports. Handled exceptions may be viewed in the “Handled Exceptions” area of the Omnissa Intelligence portal.

We limit logging handled exceptions to once per minute. If you’ve logged an exception within the last minute, we buffer the last five exceptions and send those after a minute has passed.

**Declaration**

```JAVA
public static void logHandledException (Throwable t)
```

**Parameters**

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| exception | Exception to log |

See also [Introduction to Handled Exception](../../dev-centre/ws1-intel/core-capabilities.md#handled-exceptions).

## Logging Network Request

Network Insignts automatically monitors HTTP traffic generated by either java.net.HttpURLConnection or OkHttp on devices running Android Marshmallow and earlier versions.

If you are using OkHttp version 3.3.0 and above, please see [Instrumenting OkHttpClient](#instrumenting-okhttpclient).

For other Android versions or networking libraries, you can manually capture traffic data and provide it to Omnissa Intelligence SDK with the following methods:

### logNetworkRequest(method, url, latency, bytesRead, bytesSent, responseCode, error)

This method allows developers to manually log Network Insights data. This is useful for monitoring networking libraries that Omnissa Intelligence SDK does not itself instrument.

A network request will NOT be logged in the following cases:

- A null string is provided for the method parameter.
- A null URL is provided for the URL parameter.
- A negative value is provided for the response time parameter.
- An excessively large value is provided for the response time parameter (i.e., System.currentTimeMillis() - responseTimeMillis < 0).
- A negative value is provided for the bytes read parameter.
- A negative value is provided for the bytes sent parameter.

**Declaration**

```JAVA
public static void logNetworkRequest(String method,
                                     URL url,

                                     long bytesSent,
                                     int responseCode,
                                     Exception error)
```

**Parameters**

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| method | The connection method, such as GET, POST, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS, CONNECT, PATCH |
| url | The endpoint URL |
| latency | The time between start of request and receipt of response, in milliseconds |
| bytesRead | The number of bytes included in response body |
| bytesSent | The number of bytes included in request body |
| responseCode | HTTP status code, generally 100-599, e.g. 200 == OK, 400 == Bad Request, can be 0 if there is an error |
| error | Exception instance for a failed request. Null if no error. |

This capability was introduced in Android SDK 5.1.0

Network Insights

Network Insights Best Practices

### updateLocation (curLocation)

Inform Omnissa Intelligence SDK of the device’s most recent location for use with Network Insights.

If the app uses this method to provide a recent location to the SDK, then Network Insights will tie location information to the network data.

You have the option of updating location information with data given by android.location.LocationManager.NETWORK_PROVIDER or android.location.LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER. This allows more accurate data to be sent to the server.

As explained in the Android Developer Guide, in order to receive location updates from the network or GPS provider, your `AndroidManifest.xml` file must include either the `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` or `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permissions.

**Declaration**

```JAVA
public static void updateLocation (Location curLocation)
```

**Parameters**

| --- | --- |
| location | Location of the user / device |

Introduced in Android SDK 4.2.0

## Logging User Metadata

Developers can set user metadata to tracking information about individual users. For an introduction, see [User Name](../../dev-centre/ws1-intel/core-capabilities.md#user-name-overview).

### setUsername (username)

Setting a username will allow the ability to monitor app performance for each user. We recommend setting a username to a value that can be tied back to your customer support system.

Valid inputs are strings with a length of 1 to 32 characters

**Declaration**

```JAVA
public static void setUsername (String username)
```

username

The new username

## Logging User Flows

User flows allow developers to track key interactions or user flows in their app such as login, account registration, and in app purchase.

For an introduction, see [User Flows Monitoring](../../dev-centre/ws1-intel/core-capabilities.md#user-flows-monitoring-overview).

### beginUserFlow (name)

Init and begin a user flow with a default value.

User flows allow developers to track key interactions or user flows in their app such as login, account registration, and in app purchase. The Omnissa Intelligence SDK will automatically track application load time as a user flow. You can specify additional user flows by adding code to your application.

Beginning a user flow starts a user flow. Ending, failing, or cancelling a user flow stops a user flow. Otherwise, the user flow will be marked as crashed or timed out. If a crash occurs, all in progress user flows are marked crashed and will be reported with the crash.

All user flows will appear on Omnissa Intelligence portal except for cancelled user flows.

User flows with the same name are aggregated together in the portal by Omnissa Intelligence. Only one user flow for a given name can be in progress at a given time. If you begin a second user flow with the same name while another is in progress, the first user flow will be cancelled and the new one will take its place.

**Declaration**

```JAVA
public static void beginUserFlow (String name)
```

name

The name of the user flow

## Delay Sending App Load Data

### sendAppLoadData ()

Tell Omnissa Intelligence SDK to send an app load event that was delayed. By default, Omnissa Intelligence SDK sends app load events automatically when your app is started. However, if you set ..:ref:delaySendingAppLoad <delay_sending_app_load> flag to True on config, you can call this method to manually send app load events later.

**Declaration**

```JAVA
public static void sendAppLoadData ()
```

Delay App Load Configuration

## Instrumenting OkHttpClient

Omnissa Intelligence Android SDK offers users the ability to instrument OkHttpClients to collect network insights.

### getNetworkInstrumentation()

Enables OkHttpClient instrumentation to collect network insights. It must be called on the main UI thread after the OkHttpClient is set. Once the method is invoked, Omnissa Intelligence SDK will automatically log network calls made with the returned instrumented client to the Network Insights page of the Omnissa Intelligence portal.

Here’s an example of how to instrument a client:

```JAVA
OkHttpClient uninstrumentedClient = new OkHttpClient();
OkHttpClient instrumentedClient = Crittercism.getNetworkInstrumentation().instrumentOkHttpClient(uninstrumentedClient);
// now you can use the instrumented client for network calls (on a different thread)
instrumentedClient.newCall(...).execute();
```

Introduced in Omnissa Intelligence Android SDK 5.8.11-beta11. Requires OkHttp 3.3.0 and above.

## Instrumenting WebView

Omnissa Intelligence Android SDK offers users the ability to instrument WebViews. This method only works for WebViews where JavaScript has already been enabled.

### instrumentWebView (webView)

Enables WebViews instrumentation. This method only works if JavaScript has already been enabled. It must be called on the UI thread after the WebViewClient is set and before the webpage is loaded. Once the method is invoked, Omnissa Intelligence SDK will automatically log any uncaught JavaScript exceptions to the Handled Exceptions page of the Omnissa Intelligence portal.

Here’s an example of how to configure and instrument a WebView:

```JAVA
// 1) Optionally set your own WebViewClient.
myWebView.setWebViewClient(myWebViewClient);

// 2) Enable JavaScript.
myWebView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);

// 3) Instrument WebView.
Crittercism.instrumentWebView(myWebView);
```

!!!Note
    Instrumenting WebView must be enabled in Hybrid Apps in order for API calls of Omnissa Intelligence SDK in the JavaScript code layer to communicate with the native code layer.

This capability was introduced in Android SDK 5.3.0

## Opt In Status

Omnissa Intelligence SDK provides an opt-in settings API that can 
enable or disable reporting for the Omnissa Intelligence SDK and 
can enable or disable reporting for Telemetry Features. 
Each feature can be controlled individually. 
Note that each feature can have different default settings.

This allows developers to implement code that allows end users to decide 
which reporting features they want to enable for Omnissa Intelligence.

For an introduction, see Opt Out of Omnissa Intelligence.

### getSdkOptInStatus ()
